# ufy-config

This folder contains a minimal set of configuration files essential to run [ufy](https://github.com/deepakjois/ufy):

* `ufy_pre_init.lua` – Lua file passed as an argument to flag `--lua` when invoking LuaTeX. Does some pre-initialization and loads the `ufy` Lua module.
* `fonts/Merriweather-Light.ttf` – A single TTF file bundled with ufy to make experimentation easier. See [hello.lua](https://github.com/deepakjois/ufy/blob/master/examples/hello.lua) for an example of how it could be used.
